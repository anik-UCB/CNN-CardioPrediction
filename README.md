# Convolutional-Neural-Network
Predicting cardiovascular heart disease using CNN. Here we explore different Neural Network architecture in addition to Lasso Regression with feature voting and sampling techniques to show how we can use CNN or MLP to predict heart disease using tensorflow and Keras. This is a shallow network!

The dataset (cardiacPrediction.xlsx) used here is from NHANES website. The results have been documented in the publication https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0957417420302323
